Currently, TCNJ students have no way to visualize the current availability of TCNJ's Wi-Fi network. The plan is to use two methods to collect and record data pertaining to the location and strength of the Wi-Fi signals across campus. The first method uses a custom designed hardware device, which serves as the main source of data collection. The second method via an Android application allows users to report Wi-Fi status. Data collected from users' devices are uploaded to a cloud database hosted by Parse. Calibrations are performed that sorts out differences between device characteristics to enable the creation of a unified database.  The data is then finally processed to produce a heatmap representing the Wi-Fi signal quality on the TCNJ campus.</p><p class ="clear">&nbsp;</p>
