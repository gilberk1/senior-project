    <string name="info">The goal of team Putting Wi-Fi On the Map is to\nprovide students on the TCNJ
        campus with a fully\nfeatured cell telephone application that provides\ninformation regarding
        the school’s Wi-Fi signal\navailability. Users report Wi-Fi status to collect\nand record
        data pertaining to the location and\nstrength of Wi-Fi signals across campus. Data collected
        from user devices will be uploaded to a\ndatabase and software will calibrate different
        \ndevices’ data to provide a common data format.\nThe data will be processed to produce a
        “heat\nmap” representing the Wi-Fi signal quality on the TCNJ campus. A legend will be
        provided that\nexpresses the relationship between the heat map\ncolors and the received
        signal power at the\ndevice’s front-end amplifier.\n\nThis mobile application was created
        by:\nAlexander Cook\nAbdoulaye Diallo\nKari Gilbertson\nNicholas Vitone</string>
